## What Is Metabolism?

Metabolism refers to all the chemical processes that occur within your body to maintain life. These processes convert the food you eat into energy that fuels everything from breathing and circulation to thinking and movement.

When people talk about metabolism in the context of weight management, they're typically referring to **metabolic rate** — the speed at which your body burns calories.

## Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

Your total daily energy expenditure is made up of several components:

### 1. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) — 60-70%

BMR represents the energy your body needs to perform basic life-sustaining functions at rest:

- **Breathing** and oxygen circulation
- **Heart function** and blood circulation
- **Brain activity** (the brain alone uses ~20% of resting energy)
- **Cell production** and repair
- **Organ function** (liver, kidneys, etc.)
- **Maintaining body temperature**

BMR is the largest component of daily energy expenditure and is influenced by:

| Factor | Effect on BMR |
|--------|--------------|
| Body size | Larger bodies require more energy |
| Body composition | More muscle = higher BMR |
| Age | BMR decreases ~1-2% per decade after 20 |
| Sex | Males typically have higher BMR |
| Genetics | Can account for 5-40% variation |
| Hormones | Thyroid hormones are primary regulators |

### 2. Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) — 8-15%

TEF is the energy required to digest, absorb, and process nutrients:

- **Protein**: 20-30% of calories consumed (highest TEF)
- **Carbohydrates**: 5-10% of calories consumed
- **Fats**: 0-3% of calories consumed

This is why high-protein diets can have a metabolic advantage — your body uses more energy to process protein than other macronutrients.

### 3. Physical Activity — 15-30%

This includes both structured exercise and non-exercise activity:

- **Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT)**: Planned exercise sessions
- **Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)**: All other movement — fidgeting, walking, standing, household chores

> **Key insight:** NEAT can vary by up to 2,000 calories per day between individuals and is a major factor in weight management. People who naturally fidget, stand more, or have active jobs burn significantly more calories.

## How Your Body Produces Energy

### The ATP System

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of your cells. Your body produces ATP through three main pathways:

1. **Phosphocreatine system** — Immediate energy for short, intense efforts (first 10 seconds)
2. **Anaerobic glycolysis** — Breaks down glucose without oxygen for moderate-duration efforts
3. **Aerobic metabolism** — Uses oxygen to break down carbohydrates, fats, and protein for sustained energy

### Macronutrient Metabolism

**Carbohydrate metabolism:**
- Broken into glucose → enters cells via insulin → converted to ATP
- Excess stored as glycogen (liver and muscles) or converted to fat

**Fat metabolism:**
- Broken into fatty acids and glycerol → transported to cells → converted to ATP through beta-oxidation
- Fat produces more ATP per gram but requires more oxygen

**Protein metabolism:**
- Broken into amino acids → used primarily for tissue repair and building
- Only used for energy when carbohydrate and fat are insufficient

## What Determines Your Metabolic Rate?

### Factors You Can't Change

- **Age**: Metabolism slows with age, partly due to loss of muscle mass
- **Genetics**: Your DNA influences metabolic enzymes, hormone levels, and body composition tendencies
- **Sex**: Males generally have higher metabolic rates due to greater lean mass

### Factors You Can Influence

- **Muscle mass**: Each pound of muscle burns approximately 6 calories per day at rest (vs. 2 calories for fat)
- **Physical activity level**: Both exercise and NEAT significantly impact total calorie burn
- **Diet composition**: Higher protein intake increases TEF
- **Sleep quality**: Poor sleep can reduce metabolic rate by 2-8%
- **Hydration**: Even mild dehydration can reduce metabolic efficiency

## Common Metabolism Myths

### Myth: "I have a slow metabolism"

Research shows that metabolic rate variation between individuals of similar size is typically only 200-300 calories per day. What people often attribute to a "slow metabolism" is usually:

- Lower NEAT (less daily movement)
- Underestimating calorie intake
- Metabolic adaptation from chronic dieting

### Myth: "Eating frequent small meals boosts metabolism"

The thermic effect of food is proportional to total calories consumed, not meal frequency. Six small meals burn the same TEF as three larger meals with equal total calories.

### Myth: "Certain foods are 'negative calorie'"

No food requires more energy to digest than it provides. Celery, often cited as a negative-calorie food, contains about 6 calories per stalk and requires only about 0.5 calories to digest.

## Measuring Your Metabolic Rate

### Clinical Methods

- **Indirect calorimetry**: Measures oxygen consumption and CO2 production — the gold standard
- **Doubly labeled water**: Most accurate for free-living TDEE measurement
- **Bod Pod / DEXA**: Estimates BMR from body composition data

### Estimation Formulas

The **Mifflin-St Jeor equation** is considered most accurate for estimating BMR:

- **Males**: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
- **Females**: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161

Multiply BMR by an activity factor (1.2 for sedentary to 1.9 for very active) to estimate TDEE.

## Conclusion

Understanding how metabolism works is foundational for any weight management approach. Rather than trying to "hack" your metabolism with supplements or extreme diets, focus on the factors you can control: building and maintaining muscle mass, staying physically active throughout the day, eating adequate protein, prioritizing sleep, and maintaining consistency. These evidence-based strategies provide the most reliable path to a healthy metabolic rate.
