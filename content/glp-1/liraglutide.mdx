## What is Liraglutide?

Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for both type 2 diabetes management (Victoza) and chronic weight management (Saxenda). It was one of the first GLP-1 medications to receive FDA approval for weight loss, paving the way for newer agents like semaglutide and tirzepatide.

## FDA-Approved Brands

| Brand | Approved Use | Dosing |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Saxenda** | Chronic weight management | Daily injection |
| **Victoza** | Type 2 diabetes | Daily injection |

## How Does Liraglutide Work?

Like all GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone produced in the gut after eating:

- **Appetite suppression** — signals the hypothalamus to reduce hunger
- **Slows gastric emptying** — food leaves the stomach more slowly, prolonging fullness
- **Stimulates insulin** — only when blood glucose is elevated (glucose-dependent)
- **Suppresses glucagon** — reduces liver glucose output

## Dosing Schedule (Saxenda)

Liraglutide requires **daily** subcutaneous injections, unlike weekly semaglutide.

| Week | Dose |
|------|------|
| Week 1 | 0.6 mg/day |
| Week 2 | 1.2 mg/day |
| Week 3 | 1.8 mg/day |
| Week 4 | 2.4 mg/day |
| Week 5+ | 3.0 mg/day (maintenance) |

## Effectiveness for Weight Loss

In the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial:

- Average weight loss of **8% of body weight** at 56 weeks
- 63% of patients lost ≥5% of body weight
- 33% lost ≥10% of body weight

> **Comparison note:** Semaglutide (Wegovy) achieves ~15% average weight loss — roughly twice the efficacy of liraglutide at comparable timepoints.

## Side Effects

### Common (≥5%)

- Nausea (39%) — most common, typically peaks in first 4–8 weeks
- Diarrhea (21%)
- Constipation (19%)
- Vomiting (16%)
- Headache (14%)
- Hypoglycemia (in combination with insulin/sulfonylureas)

### Serious (Rare)

- **Pancreatitis** — discontinue if suspected
- **Gallbladder disease** — rapid weight loss increases risk
- **Thyroid C-cell tumors** — boxed warning (rodent data; avoid if personal/family history of MTC or MEN2)
- **Heart rate increase** — mean increase of 2–3 bpm; monitor in patients with cardiac conditions

## Who Is a Candidate for Saxenda?

Adults with:
- BMI ≥30 (obesity), OR
- BMI ≥27 (overweight) + at least one weight-related condition (hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes)

Also FDA-approved for adolescents 12–17 with initial body weight >60 kg and BMI at or above the 95th percentile.

## Liraglutide vs Semaglutide

| Feature | Liraglutide (Saxenda) | Semaglutide (Wegovy) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Dosing frequency | Daily | Weekly |
| Average weight loss | ~8% | ~15% |
| FDA-approved age | 12+ | 12+ |
| Cardiovascular benefit | ✓ (LEADER trial) | ✓ (SELECT trial) |
| Availability | Good | Variable (shortages) |
| Cost (list price) | ~$1,400/month | ~$1,349/month |

## Cost and Insurance

- **List price:** ~$1,400/month (Saxenda)
- Insurance coverage varies — often requires documented weight loss attempts and comorbidities
- Novo Nordisk patient assistance program available for eligible patients

## Conclusion

Liraglutide was a landmark medication that validated GLP-1 therapy for weight management. While newer agents like semaglutide offer greater efficacy with the convenience of weekly dosing, liraglutide remains a valid option when:

- Newer agents are unavailable due to shortages
- Insurance covers Saxenda but not Wegovy
- Daily injection is preferred over weekly (some patients prefer smaller doses)
- Established long-term cardiovascular safety data is important to the patient

Always consult your healthcare provider to determine whether liraglutide is the right choice for your individual situation.
