## What is Liraglutide?

Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for both type 2 diabetes management (Victoza) and chronic weight management (Saxenda). It was one of the first GLP-1 medications to receive FDA approval for weight loss, paving the way for newer agents like semaglutide and tirzepatide.

## FDA-Approved Brands

| Brand | Approved Use | Dosing |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Saxenda** | Chronic weight management | Daily injection |
| **Victoza** | Type 2 diabetes | Daily injection |

## How Does Liraglutide Work?

Like all GLP-1 receptor agonists, liraglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone produced in the gut after eating:

- **Appetite suppression** — signals the hypothalamus to reduce hunger
- **Slows gastric emptying** — food leaves the stomach more slowly, prolonging fullness
- **Stimulates insulin** — only when blood glucose is elevated (glucose-dependent)
- **Suppresses glucagon** — reduces liver glucose output

Liraglutide is a derivative of GLP-1 that shares 97% amino acid sequence homology with its parent molecule[^1]. The drug was created by substituting arginine for lysine at position 34 in the GLP-1 peptide and adding a palmitic acid chain with a glutamic acid spacer on the lysine residue at position 26 to improve pharmacokinetic effects[^1]. Following subcutaneous injection, peak absorption occurs at 11 hours with a half-life of approximately 13 hours, allowing for once-daily administration[^1].

## Dosing Schedule (Saxenda)

Liraglutide requires **daily** subcutaneous injections, unlike weekly semaglutide. This daily dosing schedule is necessitated by its shorter half-life of 13-15 hours compared to semaglutide's 165-hour half-life[^2].

| Week | Dose |
|------|------|
| Week 1 | 0.6 mg/day |
| Week 2 | 1.2 mg/day |
| Week 3 | 1.8 mg/day |
| Week 4 | 2.4 mg/day |
| Week 5+ | 3.0 mg/day (maintenance) |

The dose escalation protocol helps minimize gastrointestinal side effects, which are the most common adverse events during treatment initiation[^1]. If a dose is missed for >72 hours, patients must resume dosing at 0.6 mg daily and restart the titration schedule[^1].

## Effectiveness for Weight Loss

In the SCALE Obesity and Prediabetes trial, the landmark 56-week study involving 3,731 participants without type 2 diabetes:

- Average weight loss of **8.4 kg (8.0%)** at 56 weeks compared to 2.8 kg (2.6%) with placebo (P<0.001)[^4]
- 63.2% of patients lost ≥5% of body weight (vs 27.1% with placebo)[^4]
- 33.1% lost ≥10% of body weight (vs 10.6% with placebo)[^4]
- Significant improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors including waist circumference, blood pressure, and glycemic control[^4]

> **Comparison note:** Semaglutide (Wegovy) achieves ~15% average weight loss — roughly twice the efficacy of liraglutide at comparable timepoints.

The STEP 8 trial, a head-to-head comparison of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg versus once-daily liraglutide 3.0 mg, demonstrated that semaglutide resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks (-15.8% vs -6.4%, difference -9.4 percentage points; 95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8; P<.001)[^2]. Participants had significantly greater odds of achieving ≥10%, ≥15%, and ≥20% weight loss with semaglutide versus liraglutide (odds ratios of 6.3, 7.9, and 8.2, respectively; all P<.001)[^2].

## Side Effects

### Common (≥5%)

- Nausea (39%) — most common, typically peaks in first 4–8 weeks
- Diarrhea (21%)
- Constipation (19%)
- Vomiting (16%)
- Headache (14%)
- Hypoglycemia (in combination with insulin/sulfonylureas)

### Serious (Rare)

- **Pancreatitis** — discontinue if suspected
- **Gallbladder disease** — rapid weight loss increases risk
- **Thyroid C-cell tumors** — boxed warning (rodent data; avoid if personal/family history of MTC or MEN2)
- **Heart rate increase** — mean increase of 2–3 bpm; monitor in patients with cardiac conditions

## Who Is a Candidate for Saxenda?

Adults with:
- BMI ≥30 (obesity), OR
- BMI ≥27 (overweight) + at least one weight-related condition (hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes)

Also FDA-approved for adolescents 12–17 with initial body weight >60 kg and BMI at or above the 95th percentile.

## Liraglutide vs Semaglutide

| Feature | Liraglutide (Saxenda) | Semaglutide (Wegovy) |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Dosing frequency | Daily | Weekly |
| Average weight loss | ~8% | ~15% |
| FDA-approved age | 12+ | 12+ |
| Cardiovascular benefit | ✓ (LEADER trial) | ✓ (SELECT trial) |
| Availability | Good | Variable (shortages) |
| Cost (list price) | ~$1,400/month | ~$1,349/month |

The pharmacokinetic differences between these agents explain their dosing schedules: liraglutide's half-life of 13-15 hours necessitates daily administration, while semaglutide's 165-hour half-life enables weekly dosing[^2]. Additionally, semaglutide exhibits approximately 3-fold greater potency at GLP-1 receptors than liraglutide, contributing to its superior efficacy[^3].

## Cost and Insurance

- **List price:** ~$1,400/month (Saxenda)
- Insurance coverage varies — often requires documented weight loss attempts and comorbidities
- Novo Nordisk patient assistance program available for eligible patients

## Conclusion

Liraglutide was a landmark medication that validated GLP-1 therapy for weight management. While newer agents like semaglutide offer greater efficacy with the convenience of weekly dosing, liraglutide remains a valid option when:

- Newer agents are unavailable due to shortages
- Insurance covers Saxenda but not Wegovy
- Daily injection is preferred over weekly (some patients prefer smaller doses)
- Established long-term cardiovascular safety data is important to the patient

Always consult your healthcare provider to determine whether liraglutide is the right choice for your individual situation.
