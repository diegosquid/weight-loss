## Ozempic vs Wegovy: Understanding the Differences

Ozempic and Wegovy are both brand names for semaglutide, but they're approved for different uses and have some key differences. This guide will help you understand which might be appropriate for your situation.

## What They Have in Common

### Same Active Ingredient
Both medications contain semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist that:
- Reduces appetite
- Slows gastric emptying
- Regulates blood sugar
- Promotes significant weight loss

### Same Manufacturer
Both are produced by Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company specializing in diabetes care.

### Similar Administration
- Weekly subcutaneous injections
- Pre-filled injection pens
- Self-administered at home

## Key Differences

### FDA-Approved Indications

| Feature | Ozempic | Wegovy |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Primary Use** | Type 2 Diabetes | Chronic Weight Management |
| **BMI Requirements** | None (diabetes diagnosis) | ≥30 or ≥27 with comorbidity |
| **Age Approval** | Adults 18+ | Adults 18+, Children 12+ |

### Dosage Differences

**Ozempic Dosing:**
- Starts at 0.25 mg weekly
- Maximum: 2.0 mg weekly

**Wegovy Dosing:**
- Starts at 0.25 mg weekly

The higher maximum dose of Wegovy (2.4 mg vs 2.0 mg) contributes to greater average weight loss.

### Pen Design

- Different click counts for different doses

### Blood Sugar Control

## Insurance Coverage

## Which Should You Choose?

## Off-Label Use

This is legal and common, though not FDA-approved.

## Supply Availability

## Switching Between Them

Switching is possible under medical supervision:
