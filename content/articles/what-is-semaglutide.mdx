## What is Semaglutide?

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that has revolutionized the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Originally developed as a diabetes medication, its remarkable weight loss effects led to FDA approval for chronic weight management.

## How Does Semaglutide Work?

Semaglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone naturally produced in your intestines. This hormone plays several crucial roles in metabolism:

### Appetite Regulation
Semaglutide acts on appetite centers in the brain, specifically the hypothalamus, reducing hunger signals and increasing feelings of fullness (satiety).

### Slowed Gastric Emptying
The medication slows how quickly food leaves your stomach, helping you feel full longer after meals.

### Blood Sugar Control
Semaglutide stimulates insulin release when blood sugar is high and reduces glucagon secretion, helping maintain stable glucose levels.
